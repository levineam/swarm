# Feed Generator Implementation Notes

## Overview

The Swarm Feed Generator is a custom feed generator for the Swarm app, which is a Bluesky client. The feed generator is deployed on Render.com and provides two custom feeds:

1. **Swarm Community Feed**: A feed of posts from Swarm community members
2. **Swarm Trending Feed**: A feed of trending posts from the Swarm community

The feed generator is built using Node.js and Express, and it uses the AT Protocol libraries to interact with the Bluesky API.

## Current Status

- The feed generator service is deployed on Render.com at https://swarm-feed-generator.onrender.com
- The feed generator is fully operational with a user-friendly landing page that provides information about the available feeds and endpoints
- All XRPC endpoints (`app.bsky.feed.getFeedSkeleton` and `app.bsky.feed.describeFeedGenerator`) are working correctly
- The root path handler has been successfully implemented and is serving a well-designed landing page
- **Update (March 15, 2025)**: We have successfully fixed the DID document issue by updating the service type to "BskyFeedGenerator" and the service ID to "#bsky_fg". The Swarm Social client application (https://swarm-social.onrender.com) is no longer showing the "invalid feed generator service details in did document" error.
- **Update (March 13, 2025)**: We have completed a comprehensive update of all references from `swarm-social.onrender.com` to `swarm-feed-generator.onrender.com`, fixing misconfigurations in the DID document, server endpoints, and service references. Progress has been made with some endpoints now working (health, describeFeedGenerator, getFeedSkeleton), but we still need to fix issues with the debug endpoint, DID document serving, and XRPC root endpoints.
- **Update (March 16, 2025)**: We have clarified the domain usage throughout the codebase, ensuring that `swarm-feed-generator.onrender.com` is used for feed generator service references and `swarm-social.onrender.com` is used for the main Swarm web application references.
- **Update (March 17, 2025)**: We have successfully resolved the "could not resolve identity: did:web:swarm-feed-generator.onrender.com" error. The Swarm Social client application is now fully functional and able to properly connect to the feed generator service. Users can now access the application without any DID resolution errors. The empty feed state is correctly displayed with prompts to find accounts to follow and discover custom feeds.
- **Update (March 18, 2025)**: We have identified and addressed issues with the firehose subscription that were preventing posts from appearing in the Swarm Community feed. We've implemented an admin endpoint for manually updating the feed and created a suite of troubleshooting scripts to diagnose and fix common issues. A comprehensive troubleshooting guide has been created to document these solutions.

## Domain Usage Guidelines

To maintain consistency and proper functionality, we follow these guidelines for domain usage:

### `swarm-feed-generator.onrender.com` (Feed Generator Service)
- Used for the feed generator service hostname
- Used in the feed generator service DID (`did:web:swarm-feed-generator.onrender.com`)
- Used for all feed generator service endpoints
- Used for privacy policy and terms of service URLs specific to the feed generator
- Used in environment variables related to the feed generator service

### `swarm-social.onrender.com` (Main Web Application)
- Used for references to the main Swarm web application
- Used in links pointing to the Swarm social platform
- Used when describing integration between the feed generator and the main application

It's important to maintain this distinction to ensure that:
1. The DID document correctly identifies the feed generator service
2. API endpoints are properly configured
3. Users are directed to the correct application when following links

## Service Architecture

The Swarm platform consists of two separate services:

1. **Swarm Social (Client Application)**: Deployed at https://swarm-social.onrender.com
   - A customized fork of the Bluesky web client (bskyweb)
   - Provides the user interface for interacting with the Swarm community
   - Integrates with the feed generator to display custom feeds

2. **Swarm Feed Generator**: Deployed at https://swarm-feed-generator.onrender.com
   - Implements the AT Protocol feed generator specification
   - Provides custom feeds for the Swarm community
   - Exposes XRPC endpoints for integration with Bluesky clients

These services work together to provide a complete community platform experience, with the client application handling the user interface and the feed generator providing the custom feed content.

## XRPC Endpoint Registration Issue

We've identified that some XRPC endpoints are not being registered correctly. Our diagnostic tests show that while the health endpoint is accessible and some XRPC endpoints like describeFeedGenerator and getFeedSkeleton are working, other endpoints like /xrpc and app.bsky.feed are returning 404 or 502 errors.

### Debugging Steps Taken

1. Added detailed logging to the following files:
   - `feed-generation.ts` - To log the registration of the `getFeedSkeleton` endpoint
   - `describe-generator.ts` - To log the registration of the `describeFeedGenerator` endpoint
   - `server.ts` - To log the creation and initialization of the XRPC server

2. Created a test script (`testXrpcEndpoints.js`) to verify the functionality of the XRPC endpoints.

3. Updated all references from `swarm-social.onrender.com` to `swarm-feed-generator.onrender.com` across multiple files:
   - Updated `.env` file
   - Updated `.well-known/did.json`
   - Updated `src/server.ts`
   - Updated `src/did-server.ts`
   - Updated DID document with script

4. Committed and pushed these changes to the repository for redeployment.

### Current Issues and Next Steps

1. Some endpoints are now working correctly:
   - `/health` endpoint is accessible
   - `/xrpc/app.bsky.feed.describeFeedGenerator` is working
   - `/xrpc/app.bsky.feed.getFeedSkeleton` is working

2. Some endpoints are still returning errors:
   - `/debug` endpoint is not accessible
   - `/xrpc` and `/xrpc/app.bsky.feed` are returning errors
   - The DID document may not be properly served at `/.well-known/did.json`

3. The privacy policy and terms of service URLs in the describeFeedGenerator response still point to `swarm-social.onrender.com` and need to be updated to `swarm-feed-generator.onrender.com`.

4. Next steps:
   - Update the privacy policy and terms of service URLs in the service configuration
   - Fix the debug endpoint
   - Ensure the DID document is properly served
   - Implement proper error handling for the XRPC root endpoints

## Feed Generator Architecture

The feed generator consists of the following components:

1. **Express Server**: Handles HTTP requests and serves the feed generator API
2. **XRPC Server**: Handles XRPC requests and routes them to the appropriate handlers
3. **Feed Generation Methods**: Implement the logic for generating feeds
4. **Algorithms**: Implement the specific algorithms for each feed type

### Key Files

- `server.ts`: Sets up the Express server and initializes the XRPC server
- `feed-generation.ts`: Implements the `getFeedSkeleton` endpoint
- `describe-generator.ts`: Implements the `describeFeedGenerator` endpoint
- `swarm-community-members.ts`: Contains the list of Swarm community members
- `algos/index.ts`: Exports the feed algorithms
- `algos/swarm-community.ts`: Implements the Swarm community feed algorithm
- `algos/swarm-trending.ts`: Implements the Swarm trending feed algorithm

## Deployment

The feed generator is deployed on Render.com. The deployment process is as follows:

1. Push changes to the GitHub repository
2. Render.com automatically detects the changes and rebuilds the service
3. The service is deployed to the production environment

## Implementation Details

### Feed Generator Service

The feed generator service is implemented using the AT Protocol feed generator starter kit. It is a Node.js application that uses Express to serve HTTP requests and the AT Protocol libraries to interact with the Bluesky API.

### Feed Algorithms

The feed generator currently supports the following feed algorithms:

- `swarm-community`: A feed of posts from the Swarm community
- `swarm-trending`: A feed of trending posts in the Swarm community

### DID Configuration

The feed generator uses a DID (Decentralized Identifier) to identify itself to the Bluesky network. The DID is a `did:web` identifier that points to the feed generator service.

The DID document is served at `/.well-known/did.json` and contains the necessary information for the Bluesky network to verify the identity of the feed generator.

## Issues and Solutions

### XRPC Endpoint Registration Issue

**Issue**: Some XRPC endpoints (`/xrpc` and `/xrpc/app.bsky.feed`) are not being registered correctly. The code was correct, but the endpoints were not accessible.

**Solution**: We added more logging to the server.ts, feed-generation.ts, and describe-generator.ts files to help diagnose the issue. We also created a test script to check the XRPC server configuration and endpoints.

We updated all references from `swarm-social.onrender.com` to `swarm-feed-generator.onrender.com` to ensure consistent configuration:
- Updated the `.env` file
- Updated the `.well-known/did.json` file
- Updated the `src/server.ts` file
- Updated the `src/did-server.ts` file
- Ran scripts to update the DID document

### DID Document Configuration Issue

**Issue**: The DID document was not being properly served, and it contained references to the wrong hostname.

**Solution**: We updated the DID document to use the correct hostname `swarm-feed-generator.onrender.com` instead of `swarm-social.onrender.com`. We also ensured that the document is properly served at both `/.well-known/did.json` and `/did.json`.

### Privacy Policy and Terms of Service URLs

**Issue**: The privacy policy and terms of service URLs in the describeFeedGenerator response still pointed to `swarm-social.onrender.com`.

**Solution**: We need to update these URLs in the service configuration to point to `swarm-feed-generator.onrender.com`.

### Next Steps

1. ~~Update the privacy policy and terms of service URLs in the service configuration~~ ✅
2. ~~Fix the debug endpoint~~ ✅
3. ~~Ensure the DID document is properly served~~ ✅
4. ~~Implement proper error handling for the XRPC root endpoints~~ ✅
5. ~~Monitor the service to ensure all endpoints remain accessible~~ ✅
6. ~~Update the Swarm Social client to use the feed generator with the correct configuration~~ ✅

### Future Enhancements

Now that the core functionality is working correctly, we can focus on enhancing the feed generator:

1. **Content Curation Improvements**:
   - Implement more sophisticated algorithms for the Swarm Community feed
   - Add content filtering options based on user preferences
   - Develop machine learning models for better content recommendations

2. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Optimize database queries for faster feed generation
   - Add pagination support for large feeds

3. **Monitoring and Analytics**:
   - Set up comprehensive monitoring for all endpoints

   - Create a dashboard for visualizing feed metrics

4. **User Experience**:
   - Add more customization options for feeds
   - Implement user feedback mechanisms
   - Create a more detailed landing page with documentation

5. **Integration Enhancements**:
   - Improve integration with the Swarm Social client
   - Add support for more Bluesky features as they become available
   - Develop APIs for third-party integrations

## Key Challenges and Solutions

### 1. DID Document Configuration

#### Challenge
One of the most persistent challenges was correctly configuring and serving the DID document (`did.json`) for the `did:web` identifier. Despite attempts to configure the DID document correctly, we consistently encountered a "could not resolve identity" error when attempting to use the feed.

#### Root Causes
1. **Path Resolution**: The Express server couldn't reliably locate the DID document during production deployment.
2. **Static File Serving**: There was no middleware configured to serve static files from the public directory.
3. **Build Process Issues**: The DID document wasn't being properly copied to the correct location during the build process.
4. **DID/Hostname Mismatch**: Inconsistencies between the `FEEDGEN_SERVICE_DID` and `FEEDGEN_HOSTNAME` values in the environment variables.
5. **Port Configuration**: The application wasn't properly using the PORT environment variable provided by Render.com, causing mismatches in service endpoints.
6. **Server Architecture**: The main application server wasn't properly configured to handle the DID document routes.
7. **Express dotfiles Configuration**: The Express static middleware doesn't serve dotfiles by default, which affects the `.well-known` directory.
8. **Service Type Definition**: The AT Protocol appears to require a specific service type ("BskyFeedGenerator") that differs from what we were using initially.
9. **Content-Type Headers**: The DID document needs to be served with the correct Content-Type header.
10. **Hostname Mismatch**: The service was using `swarm-social.onrender.com` in many places but the actual hostname was `swarm-feed-generator.onrender.com`.

#### Attempted Solutions
We've implemented a comprehensive series of solutions with multiple layers of redundancy:

1. **Static File Middleware**:
   ```typescript
   // Added to server.ts
   app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../public'), { dotfiles: 'allow' }));
   ```

2. **Robust DID Document Handler**:
   - Updated the `well-known.ts` handler to check multiple possible file paths
   - Added detailed logging to help diagnose issues
   - Implemented fallback generation of a basic DID document when file not found

3. **Build Process Integration**:
   - Created a post-build script (`copy-did-document.js`) that runs after TypeScript compilation
   - Added a new script (`ensure-did-document.js`) to generate the DID document at build and startup time
   - Added the scripts to `package.json` with appropriate hooks
   - Ensured the scripts handle various edge cases, including missing directories

4. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Updated from `FEEDGEN_SERVICE_DID=did:web:swarm-social.onrender.com` to `FEEDGEN_SERVICE_DID=did:web:swarm-feed-generator.onrender.com`
   - Updated from `FEEDGEN_HOSTNAME=swarm-social.onrender.com` to `FEEDGEN_HOSTNAME=swarm-feed-generator.onrender.com`

5. **Direct Static File Approach**:
   - Created a static `did.json` file in the public directory that gets served directly
   - This provides a reliable fallback when other methods fail
   - The static file contains all necessary DID document components including verification methods and service endpoints

6. **Port Configuration Fix**:
   - Updated the server to properly use the PORT environment variable provided by Render.com
   - Added fallback logic to ensure a default port is used if not specified
   - Ensured consistent port usage across all service endpoint references

7. **Dedicated DID Server**:
   - Created a separate Express server specifically for serving the DID document
   - Implemented in a dedicated module (`did-server.ts`) to keep concerns separated
   - Added comprehensive error handling and debugging endpoints
   - Configured to check multiple possible file paths for the DID document
   - Implemented dynamic DID document generation as a fallback
   - Added a `/debug` endpoint to help diagnose issues in production
   - Updated the hostname from `swarm-social.onrender.com` to `swarm-feed-generator.onrender.com`

8. **Specific AT Protocol Requirements**:
   - Updated the service type from 'AtprotoFeedGenerator' to 'BskyFeedGenerator'
   - Updated the service ID from '#atproto_feed_generator' to '#bsky_fg'
   - Set proper Content-Type headers (`application/json`)
   - Added Cache-Control headers to prevent CDN caching issues

#### Progress and Remaining Issues
We've made significant progress:
- The health endpoint is now accessible
- The describeFeedGenerator endpoint is working
- The getFeedSkeleton endpoint is working

However, we still have a few issues to resolve:
- The debug endpoint is not accessible
- The DID document may not be properly served
- Some XRPC root endpoints are still returning errors
- The privacy policy and terms of service URLs still point to the wrong hostname

### Update: Domain Reference Update

After investigating the errors, we discovered that many references to `swarm-social.onrender.com` remained in the codebase. We've systematically updated all of these references to use `swarm-feed-generator.onrender.com` instead.

#### Changes Made
1. Updated the `.env` file with the correct hostname and service DID
2. Updated the `.well-known/did.json` file with the correct hostname
3. Updated the `src/server.ts` file to use the correct hostname for privacy policy and terms of service URLs
4. Updated the `src/did-server.ts` file to use the correct hostname as the default
5. Ran scripts to update the DID document in multiple locations

#### Lessons Learned
- It's crucial to maintain consistent hostnames across all configuration files and code
- When changing a service's domain, a systematic approach is needed to update all references
- Testing each endpoint after such changes is essential to verify everything is working correctly

### 2. Firehose Subscription Issues

#### Challenge
Users reported that their posts were not appearing in the Swarm Community feed, despite being correctly listed in the `SWARM_COMMUNITY_MEMBERS` array. After investigation, we discovered several issues related to the firehose subscription.

#### Root Causes
1. **Service Hibernation**: Render's free tier services hibernate after 15 minutes of inactivity, causing the firehose subscription to disconnect.
2. **Non-persistent Storage**: The database is not persisted between service restarts on Render's free tier, causing indexed posts to be lost.
3. **HTTP Method Handling**: The service was returning HTTP 405 "Method Not Allowed" errors for HEAD requests, which may impact the firehose subscription.
4. **Subscription Reconnection**: The feed generator wasn't properly reconnecting to the firehose after service restarts or hibernation.
5. **Database Reset**: Each time the service restarts, the SQLite database is reset, losing all previously indexed posts.

#### Implemented Solutions

1. **Admin Endpoint for Manual Feed Updates**:
   - Created an admin endpoint (`/admin/update-feed`) that allows manually adding posts to the feed
   - Implemented a database stats endpoint (`/admin/stats`) to check the current state of the database
   - Added proper error handling and validation for the admin endpoints

2. **Troubleshooting Scripts**:
   - `check-feed-generator-env.js`: Checks the feed generator's environment variables
   - `check-firehose-subscription.js`: Checks if the feed generator is properly subscribing to the firehose
   - `check-feed-database.js`: Checks if posts are being stored in the database
   - `restart-feed-generator.js`: Restarts the feed generator service and reconnects to the firehose
   - `fix-feed-generator-database.js`: Generates SQL statements to manually add posts to the database
   - `create-test-post.js`: Creates a test post to verify if it gets indexed
   - `test-feed-indexing.js`: Tests if the feed generator is properly indexing posts

3. **Service Maintenance Script**:
   - Created a `keep-service-active.js` script that periodically pings the service to prevent hibernation
   - This script can be run on a separate server or locally to keep the feed generator active

4. **Comprehensive Troubleshooting Guide**:
   - Created a detailed troubleshooting guide (`docs/feed-generator-troubleshooting.md`) that documents common issues and solutions
   - The guide includes step-by-step instructions for diagnosing and fixing feed generator issues

#### Lessons Learned
1. **Free Tier Limitations**: Render's free tier has significant limitations that affect the feed generator's reliability:
   - Service hibernation after 15 minutes of inactivity
   - Non-persistent storage between service restarts
   - Limited resources affecting performance

2. **Firehose Subscription Complexity**: The AT Protocol firehose subscription is complex and requires careful handling:
   - Proper reconnection logic is essential
   - The service must handle various HTTP methods correctly
   - The subscription can be affected by network issues and service restarts

3. **Database Persistence**: For reliable operation, the feed generator needs persistent storage:
   - SQLite is not ideal for services that restart frequently
   - A cloud-hosted database would be more reliable but requires additional configuration

4. **Manual Intervention Options**: Having manual intervention options is crucial for services with potential reliability issues:
   - Admin endpoints for manual updates
   - Scripts for diagnosing and fixing common issues
   - Clear documentation for troubleshooting

#### Next Steps
1. **Consider Upgrading to Paid Tier**: For improved reliability, consider upgrading to a paid Render tier with:
   - No service hibernation
   - Persistent storage
   - More resources for better performance

2. **Implement Database Backup**: Create a mechanism to periodically backup the database to prevent data loss during service restarts.

3. **Enhance Firehose Subscription**: Improve the firehose subscription implementation with:
   - More robust reconnection logic
   - Better error handling
   - Detailed logging for debugging

4. **Monitor Service Health**: Set up monitoring to detect and alert on service issues:
   - Regular health checks
   - Alerts for service hibernation
   - Monitoring of database state and post indexing

## Lessons Learned

1. **DID Document Complexity**: Working with DIDs and the AT Protocol requires careful attention to detail in the DID document structure and deployment configuration.

2. **Testing in Development vs. Production**: There are significant differences between local development and production deployment that need to be accounted for, particularly with path resolution and static file serving.

3. **Express Middleware Configuration**: Proper configuration of Express middleware is crucial for serving static files in a TypeScript application deployed to production.

4. **Build Process Integration**: Adding custom steps to the build process can solve deployment issues that are difficult to address through code alone.

5. **Environment Variable Management**: Clear separation of environment variables for different environments (development vs. production) helps prevent confusion and deployment issues.

6. **Logging and Debugging**: Detailed logging is invaluable for diagnosing issues in production environments where direct debugging is not possible.

7. **Multiple Redundancy Layers**: Implementing multiple approaches to solve critical issues (like serving the DID document) provides resilience against unexpected deployment problems.

8. **Port Configuration**: Always use the PORT environment variable provided by the hosting platform rather than hardcoding port values, as this can cause service endpoint mismatches.

9. **Separation of Concerns**: Creating dedicated servers for specific functionality (like serving the DID document) can simplify debugging and maintenance.

10. **Diagnostic Endpoints**: Adding diagnostic endpoints (like `/debug`) in production can provide valuable information for troubleshooting without requiring server restarts or log access.

11. **AT Protocol Service Types**: The AT Protocol requires specific service types (e.g., "BskyFeedGenerator" instead of "AtprotoFeedGenerator") for proper resolution.

12. **HTTP Headers Matter**: Proper Content-Type and Cache-Control headers are crucial for ensuring correct interpretation and preventing caching issues.

13. **Client-Side Resolution**: Remember that errors might be occurring on the client side during resolution, not necessarily on the server side.

14. **Methodical Testing**: When dealing with complex distributed systems like the AT Protocol, systematic testing of each component is essential to isolate and fix issues.

15. **Domain Consistency**: When using a specific domain for a service, it's crucial to maintain consistency across all configuration files, environment variables, and code references.

16. **Free Tier Limitations**: When using free tier services like Render, be aware of limitations such as service hibernation and non-persistent storage that can affect reliability.

17. **Manual Intervention Options**: For services with potential reliability issues, having manual intervention options (like admin endpoints) is crucial for maintaining functionality.

18. **Comprehensive Troubleshooting**: Creating detailed troubleshooting guides and diagnostic scripts helps users and developers quickly identify and fix common issues.

19. **Service Maintenance**: For services on free tiers, implementing maintenance scripts (like keep-service-active.js) can help mitigate hibernation issues.
