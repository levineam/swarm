# Step 6: Phase Out Manual Workarounds - Execution Plan

## Problem
Manual interventions (admin endpoint and hourly script) bypass core issues and create maintenance overhead.

## Actions to Take

### 1. Verify Fixes
- Check the feed output to confirm that Steps 1 and 2 have resolved the feed issues
- Verify that posts from community members are appearing in the feed without manual intervention
- Monitor the firehose connection to ensure it remains stable

### 2. Remove Admin Endpoint
- Modify `server.ts` to remove the admin router:
  - Remove the import: `import { createAdminRouter } from './admin'`
  - Remove the line: `const adminRouter = createAdminRouter(db)`
  - Remove the line: `app.use('/admin', adminRouter)`
- Optionally, rename or archive the `admin.ts` file to prevent future use

### 3. Disable Hourly GitHub Action
- Rename the GitHub Actions workflow file `.github/workflows/auto-add-community-posts.yml` to `.github/workflows/auto-add-community-posts.yml.disabled`
- This preserves the file for reference but prevents it from running

### 4. Monitor Feed Performance
- Set up a monitoring period of at least 48 hours
- Check the feed regularly to ensure posts appear without manual help
- Review logs for any errors or issues
- Document the results of the monitoring period

## Expected Outcome
- A fully automated feed generation process
- Elimination of manual workarounds
- Reduced maintenance overhead
- Improved reliability and user experience

## Implementation Timeline
- Day 1: Verify fixes and remove admin endpoint
- Day 1-3: Monitor feed performance
- Day 3: Disable GitHub Action if monitoring confirms fixes are working
- Day 4: Final review and documentation
