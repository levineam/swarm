# Step 5: Automate Testing and Deployment - Execution Summary

## Actions Completed

### 1. Set Up CI/CD
- Created a GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/test-and-deploy.yml` that:
  - Runs on pushes to the main branch that affect the swarm-feed-generator directory
  - Sets up Node.js 18 with Yarn
  - Installs dependencies
  - Runs linting, tests, and TypeScript compilation
  - Deploys to Render using a deploy hook (when on the main branch)

### 2. Enhanced Testing
- Created additional test files:
  - `tests/subscription.test.ts`: Tests for the firehose subscription functionality
  - `tests/logger.test.ts`: Tests for the Winston logger implementation
- Ensured existing tests for the feed algorithm are comprehensive

### 3. Code Quality Improvements
- Added ESLint configuration in `.eslintrc.js` with:
  - TypeScript support
  - Rules for code quality and consistency
  - Special handling for unused variables and console logs
- Added a lint script to package.json

### 4. Documentation
- Updated the README.md with:
  - Comprehensive information about the improvements made
  - Setup and usage instructions
  - Testing and deployment documentation

## Impact
- Automated testing ensures code quality and prevents regressions
- Continuous deployment reduces manual effort and potential for errors
- Improved code quality through linting and testing
- Better documentation makes the project more maintainable

## Status
**Done**
